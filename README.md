Group Project The Stevens book store is too expensive and doesnâ€™t have enough variety. Our website seeks to offer a better alternative for purchasing Stevens apparel by addressing these concerns. We believe that people should be able to express their school spirit without being subject to any financial barriers. Selling apparel directly from a website is associated with drastically lower costs of operations compared to a physical store, and thus, will considerably lower prices.
